-What is the OSI model?
It is a 7-layer theoretical model for understanding and troubleshooting computers and computer networking.

-What is Layer 1?
Physical layer, consists of hardware, electrical or light signals; it also encompasses all of the other layers.

-What is Layer 2?
Data Link Layer, it describes how computers inside of a single LAN or subnet communicate, i.e. using ARP and 
MAC addresses mainly. Switches live here, unless they are multi-layer/layer 3.

-What is Layer 3?
Network layer, this allows discrete networks or subnets to communicate with one another. This process is facilitated
by routers and/or multi-layer switches. This is where IP addresses come into play.

-What is Layer 4?
Transport layer, this is where TCP/UDP ports live. These ports are used to allow computers to communicate with each other
on multiple streams simultaneously, e.g. you might request a file from your network file server and ping it at the same time,
in this scenario you would be using ports 20 and 19 at the same time.

-What is Layer 5?
Session layer,
