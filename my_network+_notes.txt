======== OSI MODEL

-What is the OSI model?
It is a 7-layer theoretical model for understanding and troubleshooting computers and computer networking.

-What is Layer 1?
Physical layer, consists of hardware, electrical or light signals; it also encompasses all of the other layers.

-What is Layer 2?
Data Link Layer, it describes how computers inside of a single LAN or subnet communicate, i.e. using ARP and 
MAC addresses mainly. Switches live here, unless they are multi-layer/layer 3.

-What is Layer 3?
Network layer, this allows discrete networks or subnets to communicate with one another. This process is facilitated
by routers and/or multi-layer switches. This is where IP addresses come into play.

-What is Layer 4?
Transport layer, this is where TCP/UDP ports live. These ports are used to allow computers to communicate with each other
on multiple streams simultaneously, e.g. you might request a file from your network file server and ping it at the same time,
in this scenario you would be using ports 20 and 19 at the same time.

-What is Layer 5?
Session layer, responsible for initiating, managing, and closing communication sessions between 2+ devices.

-What is Layer 6?
Presentation layer, responsible for translating data into a format that can be understood by humans.

-What is Layer 7?
Application layer, closest layer to end users. It is the layer that directly interacts with the actual applications running
on a machine.

======== DATA ENCAPSULATION

-What is an ethernet header?
The ethernet header contains information needed in order to route the packet within a LAN, e.g. source MAC, destination MAC,
File CheckSum, length of packet, etc.

-What is an IP header?
IP headers contain information needed in order to route a packet between different LANs, e.g. source IP, destination IP,
version (e.g. IPv4 or IPv6), length, total length, TTL, flags, etc.

-What is a TCP/UDP header?
TCP headers contain information needed in order to route packets to the correct ports, e.g. source and destination ports,
sequence number (for when a transmission needs to be broken up into multiple packets), flags (e.g. SYN, ACK, FIN, RST).

In contrast, UDP headers include far less information as it is not a connection-oriented protocol, e.g. source port,
destination port, length, checksum.

-What are TCP flags?
TCP flags are used to initiate, manage, control, and terminate connections: SYN is used to initiate a session, SYN/ACK is used to
agree to the session, ACK is used to acknowledge receipt of packets, FIN is used to signal that the device has finished transmitting and wants to terminate the session, RST is used to reset a session, URG is used to signal that certain data in the packet requires immediate attention, PSH is used to request immediate data delivery to the receiving application.

-What is a payload?
The actual Layer 7 data that an end user is attempting to transmit, e.g. the actual contents of an email as opposed to all of the surrounding
information that is needed in order to route the packet, translate the bits, etc.

-What is an MTU?
Maximum transmission unit, the largest packet (measured in bytes) that can be transmitted over the network; it is 1518 bytes by default,
but can also be adjusted to allow runt and jumbo packets.

========= CHARACTERISTICS OF NETWORK TOPOLOGIES AND NETWORK TYPES

NETWORK TOPOLOGIES

-What is a mesh network?
A mesh network is one where every device in the network is directly connected to all other network devices, so that transmissions do not need to pass through a central node to reach the destination; instead, it can be transmitted directly to it.

-What is a star/hub and spoke network?
Star/HnS networks contain a central node that connects to all of the other endpoints in the network. However, the endpoints do not connect directly to each other, and therefore all data must pass through the central node.

-What is a bus network?s
A bus network is one in which there is a single cable that runs along the length of the entire network, and where all endpoints connect to this cable and take turns using it to transmit data. Bus networks are half-duplex by nature, ergo they have been largely phased out in favor of full duplex networks, e.g. star or mesh.

-What is a ring network?
A ring network is one in which endpoints are connected only to the previous and the next endpoint in the topology, forming a ring shape. Data is transmitted in only one direction, and often these networks use a token to control which device is currently allowed to transmit data.

-What is a hybrid network?
A hybrid network combines characteristics of two or more network topologies, e.g. you might have a star network that also incorporates some connections between endpoints, making it somewhat like a mesh network.

-

NETWORK TYPES

-What is a peer to peer network?
A P2P network is one in which endpoints are directly connected to each other, e.g. in Limewire users share files amongst themselves instead of downloading from a centralized server.

-What is a client-server network?
A client-server network is pretty much the standard network type, e.g. a client device such as a laptop requesting a webpage from a webserver owned by Microsoft.

-What is a LAN?
Local Area Network, describes a SOHO type of network, e.g. your home network or a small business.

-What is a MAN?
Metropolitan Area Network, describes a network that spans across a few buildings in the same city, e.g. a company that runs its business out of a few buildings such as headquarters and branch offices in the same city.

-What is a WAN?
Wide Area Network, connections that span across long distance, e.g. an ISP router that connects to another ISP router several miles away, and the next one, and the next one, so that together they span across an entire country, which separate LANs that are very far away from each other to communicate. Because of their nature, WANs can use both public and private infrastructure, as well as different types of hardware and cabling.

-What is a WLAN?
Wireless LAN, it is a LAN that uses wireless signals instead of cabled connections.

-What is a PAN?
Personal Area Network, it is a network that is localized to an individual or a few individuals, e.g. a person with an iPhone who is using AirPods has a PAN set up that allows them to listen to music.

-What is a CAN?
Campus Area Networks span across the length of a college campus, e.g. an actual college, Google headquarters, etc.

-What is a SAN?
Storage Area Network, special high-speed network that separates storage from servers. The storage is centralized and is block level versus file level (NAS). They usually use fiber connections.

-What is a SDWAN?
Software-Defined WAN, applies SDN principles to WAN, e.g. centralized control which would allow admins/engineers to shape traffic and implement dynamic routing, load balancing, application visibility (allowing admins to prioritize certain apps over others), cloud integration, and more!

-What is MPLS?
Multi-Protocol Label Switching, protocol used in WANs to allow packet management using labels. It is fairly similar to VLAN tagging.

-What is mGRE?
Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation, came from GRE which is used to encapsulate many network protocols inside one P2P connection. mGRE expands upon this and allows for multiple endpoints to communicate using a single GRE tunnel.

SERVICE-RELATED ENTRY POINT

-What is a demarcation point?
A demarc is the physical or logical point in an organization's network where the jurisdiction of the org ends and that of the ISP begins, e.g. the network jack in the MDF that connects the organization's network to its ISP router.

-What is a smartjack?
A smartjack is a hardware device that can be placed at a demarc that offers features for monitoring the demarc, or even providing power.

VIRTUAL NETWORK CONCEPTS

-What is a vSwitch?
Virtual switch, does most everything a physical switch does, except it is virtual and lives in a virtual network.

-What is a vNIC?
Virtual NIC, does everything a NIC does except it is virtual and lives on a VM.

-What is Network function virtualization (NFV)?
Approach to networking that involves virtualizing traditional network hardware on VMs, e.g. firewalls, load balancers, routers, switches.

-What is a hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that allows you to create and run virtual machines, e.g. Hyper-V and VMWare.

PROVIDER LINKS

-Satellite?
Satellite link uses satellites to transmit/receive data, e.g. Starlink.

-Cable?
Cable connections use existing cable TV infrastructure for internet access.

-DSL?
DSL uses traditional copper telephone lines, but in such a way that it doesn't interfere with voice transmission. Contrast with dial-up connections.

-Leased line?
Connections that are rented from a service provider, offers more privacy and reliability than non-leased lines.

-Metro-optical?
A fiber connection that is confined to a single metropolitan area.
