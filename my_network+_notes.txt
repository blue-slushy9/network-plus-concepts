======== OSI MODEL

-What is the OSI model?
It is a 7-layer theoretical model for understanding and troubleshooting computers and computer networking.

-What is Layer 1?
Physical layer, consists of hardware, electrical or light signals; it also encompasses all of the other layers.

-What is Layer 2?
Data Link Layer, it describes how computers inside of a single LAN or subnet communicate, i.e. using ARP and 
MAC addresses mainly. Switches live here, unless they are multi-layer/layer 3.

-What is Layer 3?
Network layer, this allows discrete networks or subnets to communicate with one another. This process is facilitated
by routers and/or multi-layer switches. This is where IP addresses come into play.

-What is Layer 4?
Transport layer, this is where TCP/UDP ports live. These ports are used to allow computers to communicate with each other
on multiple streams simultaneously, e.g. you might request a file from your network file server and ping it at the same time,
in this scenario you would be using ports 20 and 19 at the same time.

-What is Layer 5?
Session layer, responsible for initiating, managing, and closing communication sessions between 2+ devices.

-What is Layer 6?
Presentation layer, responsible for translating data into a format that can be understood by humans.

-What is Layer 7?
Application layer, closest layer to end users. It is the layer that directly interacts with the actual applications running
on a machine.

======== DATA ENCAPSULATION

-What is an ethernet header?
The ethernet header contains information needed in order to route the packet within a LAN, e.g. source MAC, destination MAC,
File CheckSum, length of packet, etc.

-What is an IP header?
IP headers contain information needed in order to route a packet between different LANs, e.g. source IP, destination IP,
version (e.g. IPv4 or IPv6), length, total length, TTL, flags, etc.

-What is a TCP/UDP header?
TCP headers contain information needed in order to route packets to the correct ports, e.g. source and destination ports,
sequence number (for when a transmission needs to be broken up into multiple packets), flags (e.g. SYN, ACK, FIN, RST).

In contrast, UDP headers include far less information as it is not a connection-oriented protocol, e.g. source port,
destination port, length, checksum.

-What are TCP flags?
TCP flags are used to initiate, manage, control, and terminate connections: SYN is used to initiate a session, SYN/ACK is used to
agree to the session, ACK is used to acknowledge receipt of packets, FIN is used to signal that the device has finished transmitting and wants to terminate the session, RST is used to reset a session, URG is used to signal that certain data in the packet requires immediate attention, PSH is used to request immediate data delivery to the receiving application.

-What is a payload?
The actual Layer 7 data that an end user is attempting to transmit, e.g. the actual contents of an email as opposed to all of the surrounding
information that is needed in order to route the packet, translate the bits, etc.

-What is an MTU?
Maximum transmission unit, the largest packet (measured in bytes) that can be transmitted over the network; it is 1518 bytes by default,
but can also be adjusted to allow runt and jumbo packets.

========= CHARACTERISTICS OF NETWORK TOPOLOGIES AND NETWORK TYPES

NETWORK TOPOLOGIES

-What is a mesh network?
A mesh network is one where every device in the network is directly connected to all other network devices, so that transmissions do not need to pass through a central node to reach the destination; instead, it can be transmitted directly to it.

-What is a star/hub and spoke network?
Star/HnS networks contain a central node that connects to all of the other endpoints in the network. However, the endpoints do not connect directly to each other, and therefore all data must pass through the central node.

-What is a bus network?s
A bus network is one in which there is a single cable that runs along the length of the entire network, and where all endpoints connect to this cable and take turns using it to transmit data. Bus networks are half-duplex by nature, ergo they have been largely phased out in favor of full duplex networks, e.g. star or mesh.

-What is a ring network?
A ring network is one in which endpoints are connected only to the previous and the next endpoint in the topology, forming a ring shape. Data is transmitted in only one direction, and often these networks use a token to control which device is currently allowed to transmit data.

-What is a hybrid network?
A hybrid network combines characteristics of two or more network topologies, e.g. you might have a star network that also incorporates some connections between endpoints, making it somewhat like a mesh network.

-

NETWORK TYPES

-What is a WAN?
Wide Area Network, connections that span across long distance, e.g. an ISP router that connects to another ISP router several miles away, and the next one, and the next one, so that together they span across an entire country, which separate LANs that are very far away from each other to communicate. Because of their nature, WANs can use both public and private infrastructure, as well as different types of hardware and cabling.

-What is a WLAN?
Wireless LAN, it is a LAN that uses wireless signals instead of cabled connections.

-What is a PAN?
Personal Area Network, it is a network that is localized to an individual or a few individuals, e.g. a person with an iPhone who is using AirPods has a PAN set up that allows them to listen to music.

-What is a CAN?
Campus Area Networks span across the length of a college campus, e.g. an actual college, Google headquarters, etc.

-What is a SAN?
Storage Area Network, special high-speed network that separates storage from servers. The storage is centralized and is block level versus file level (NAS). They usually use fiber connections.

-What is a SDWAN?
Software-Defined WAN, applies SDN principles to WAN, e.g. centralized control which would allow admins/engineers to shape traffic and implement dynamic routing, load balancing, application visibility (allowing admins to prioritize certain apps over others), cloud integration, and more!

-What is MPLS?
Multi-Protocol Label Switching, protocol used in WANs to allow packet management using labels. It is fairly similar to VLAN tagging.

-What is mGRE?
Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation, came from GRE which is used to encapsulate many network protocols inside one P2P connection. mGRE expands upon this and allows for multiple endpoints to communicate using a single GRE tunnel.

SERVICE-RELATED ENTRY POINT

-What is a demarcation point?
A demarc is the physical or logical point in an organization's network where the jurisdiction of the org ends and that of the ISP begins, e.g. the network jack in the MDF that connects the organization's network to its ISP router.

-What is a smartjack?
A smartjack is a hardware device that can be placed at a demarc that offers features for monitoring the demarc, or even providing power.

VIRTUAL NETWORK CONCEPTS

-What is a vSwitch?
Virtual switch, does most everything a physical switch does, except it is virtual and lives in a virtual network.

-What is a vNIC?
Virtual NIC, does everything a NIC does except it is virtual and lives on a VM.

-What is Network function virtualization (NFV)?
Approach to networking that involves virtualizing traditional network hardware on VMs, e.g. firewalls, load balancers, routers, switches.

-What is a hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that allows you to create and run virtual machines, e.g. Hyper-V and VMWare.

PROVIDER LINKS

-Satellite?
Satellite link uses satellites to transmit/receive data, e.g. Starlink.

-Cable?
Cable connections use existing cable TV infrastructure for internet access.

-DSL?
DSL uses traditional copper telephone lines, but in such a way that it doesn't interfere with voice transmission. Contrast with dial-up connections.

-Leased line?
Connections that are rented from a service provider, offers more privacy and reliability than non-leased lines.

-Metro-optical?
A fiber connection that is confined to a single metropolitan area.

Baseband is a mode of data transmission that does not require modulation, i.e. converting a signal from one type to another. For instance, a modem is a networking device that converts digital signals (which is what computers use) to analog (e.g. telephone) in order to transmit computer data over telephone infrastructure. Baseband also uses the entire bandwidth for a single channel, whereas broadband uses the bandwidth for multiple channels.

COPPER

-10Base-T?
One of the original Ethernet standards defined in 802.3; "10" means 10 Mbps, "Base" means baseband transmission, and "T" means twisted pair.

-100Base-TX?
Ethernet standard, 100 Mbps, uses CAT5 and higher cables, RJ45 connectors, star topology, full duplex.

-Bidirectional wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)?
Allows for the simultaneous bidirectional transmission (send/receive) of optical signals on a single fiber using two different wavelengths of light. Traditional WDM only allows for unidirectional transmission or reception over a single fiber.

######## IP ADDRESSING

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 

-RFC1918?
"Address allocation for private internets", defines three ranges of IP addresses for use in private networks:
10.x.x.x
172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x
192.168.x.x

-NAT?
Network address translation, protocol that converts public IP addresses into private ones, and vice-versa. 

-PAT?
Port address translation, component of NAT, uses Layer 4 port numbers to keep track of which host in the internal network should receive which packets. This is because the entire internal network uses a single IP address, ergo PAT is used to keep track of which packets go to which host in the network.

IPv4 vs IPv6

-Automatic Private IP?
Feature of MS windows, it is an address in the 169.254.x.x/16 range that gets assigned to a DHCP client when it can't reach the DHCP server. APIPA provides local connectivity, but no internet access.

-EUI-64?
Extended Unique Identifier-64, used in IPv6 networks to create interface IDs for network devices based on their MAC address, especially in SLAAC. 

-Multicast?
A mode of packet delivery that entails sending the same data from one source to multiple destination.

-Unicast?
A mode of packet delivery that entails sending data from one source to one destination.

-Anycast?
A mode of packet delivery that involves sending data from one source to one destination IP address, however in Anycast multiple endpoints are configured with the same IP address and the actual destination is based upon geographic proximity to the source. Example: Amazon.com might have hundreds of webservers configured with the same IP address, which webserver actually receives and serves requests is based on the location of the client.

-Broadcast?
Unlike the other modes of communication, broadcast only exists in IPv4 and not IPv6. This is because it requires a lot of overhead, which the engineers behind IPv6 did not want included. Broadcast traffic involves sending the same data from one source to every other endpoint on the same subnet.

-Link local?
IPv6 feature, it is an address that gets assigned automatically to all devices in a subnet. It is used only for communicating within that same subnet. The address is often generated by individual devices, in a non-centralized manner, using SLAAC.

-Loopback?
Loopback address in IPv4 is 127.0.0.1. It always points to the localhost, it is often used for testing connectivity issues while bypassing the physical layer. In IPv6, the address is ::1.

-Default gateway?
This is the IP address of the router or multilayer switch interface that faces the internal network/subnet. It is the gateway to other networks, including the internet, hence the name.

IPv4 SUBNETTING

-Classless (VLSM)?
Classless routing simply means it does not use classful routing, which assigns subnet mask based on the value of the first byte in the IP address. Variable length subnet masking means the same thing, the subnet mask is not determined by IP address range.

-Classful?
*With the exception of the private IP address ranges:
A = 1.0.0.0 - 126.0.0.0, /8
B = 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0, /16
C = 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0, /24
D = Multicast group addressing = 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
E = Experimental use = 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255

-CIDR?
Classless Inter-Domain Routing, more efficient subnet mask notation than standard decimal or binary notation. It used a slash followed by the number of 1s in your subnet mask, e.g. /8 = 255.0.0.0 = 11111111.0.0.0

IPv6 CONCEPTS

-Tunneling?
Process of encapsulating IPv6 packets inside of other protocols (e.g. IPv4) in order to transmit IPv6 packets over networks that may not natively support it.

-Dual stack?
Simultaneous use of both IPv4 and IPv6 in the same network and/or devices. Devices have both v4 and v6 addresses, apps running on the network can work with both v4 and v6, etc.

-Shorthand notation?
Leading zeros can be omitted, both within the 16-bit blocks and the entire IPv6 address, e.g. "2001:0db8" is also "2001:db8". A single set of consecutive blocks of zeros can be shortened to "::", e.g. "2001:0000:0000:0000:2022:EFFBAB" = "2001::2022:EFFBAB". A single block of zeros can be shortened to just one zero, e.g. "0000" = "0". 

-Router advertisement?
Component of NDP, neighbor discovery protocol. Responsible for stateless autoconfiguration, address resolution, duplicate address detection, etc.

-SLAAC?
StateLess Address AutoConfiguration, replacement for DHCPv6. Allows devices on IPv6 networks to configure their IP addressing without a centralized (e.g. DHCP) service.

-Virtual IP (VIP)?
Associated with a service or resource that lives in the network, rather than a host. This is done for load balancing and network management purposes. 

-Sub-interface?
An interface on a router or switch configured as part of a VLAN. It is associated with a physical interface on the network device, and relies upon it being up and operational, but it is not the same thing as the physical interface, i.e. the physical interface and its subinterface(s) do not belong to the same (V)LANs. 

##### PORTS AND PROTOCOLS

-FTP?
File Transfer Protocol, TCP port 20/21 (20 is used for control, 21 is used for data) used for sending/receiving files, usually from a fileserver. Can also be from just any host to another, still using client-server architecture. Insecure because it transmits in plaintext.

-SNMP?
Simple Network Management Protocol, UDP port 161/162, 161 is used by SNMP clients to listen for instructions from the SNMP server, 162 is used by the SNMP manager to listen for incoming traps. SNMP is used for managing and monitoring network devices from a SNMP manager (management systems).

-LDAP?
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, TCP port 389, used for directory services, i.e. a centralized database that stores information about users, groups, devices, and other resources in a network or organization. In particular, LDAP is designed for querying and modifying directory information. LDAP uses client-server architecture. EXAMPLE: Microsoft Active Directory uses LDAP.

-HTTPS?

-LDAPS?
LDAP over SSL, TCP port 636, uses encryption and digital certificates. Enhances security be encrypting data sent between LDAP client and server, uses encryption, authentication, and certificates.

-IMAPS?
IMAP over SSL, uses TCP port 993, adds encryption and authentication to IMAP.

-POP3S?

-SIP?
Session Initiation Protocol, uses TCP port 5060/5061. 5060 is used for unencrypted communication, 5061 is used to add encryption. SIP initiates, manages, and ends sessions, e.g. VoIP.

IP PROTOCOL TYPES

-ICMP?
Internet Control Message Protocol, doesn't use a TCP port because it is a protocol that lives in the lower levels of the OSI model. ICMP is most commonly used with the 'ping' command to test network connectivity and interface status of network devices. More widely, it is used for network diagnostics and troubleshooting.

-TCP?
Connection-oriented protocol, three-way handshake, uses port numbers assigned to specific protocols and communication channels. TCP is used when a reliable connection is needed, e.g. when sending important information which you want to make sure will be received.

-UDP?
Connectionless protocol, used when speed is more important than reliability, e.g. on a video call. Some packets will not reach the destination, but since it's a video chat, it will just pick up from the next packet from the one that got lost.

-GRE?
Generic Routing Encapsulation, allows for transmitting multiple data streams and/or protocols over a single channel.

-IPSec?
Suite of protocols used to secure communication over IP networks, namely the internet. Examples: VPNs, Transport mode (encrypt only the payload), Tunnel mode (encrypt entire packet); Protocols: AH, ESP. Many IPsec implementations use both AH and ESP (see below).

-AH/ESP?
Authentication Header/Encapsulating Security Payload. AH provides authentication and data integrity for IP packets, no encryption. ESP provides encryption and data confidentiality. 

-Connectionless vs Connection-Oriented Protocols?
Connectionless protocols use UDP ports, connection-oriented protocols use TCP ports. Connectionless protocols are favored when speed is more important than reliability, e.g. video calls. It doesn't matter if a few packets in the video call session get dropped, the video and audio will still be more than comprehensible.

###### NETWORK SERVICES

DHCP

-Scope?
DHCP scope defines the range of IP addresses that will be served by the DHCP server, e.g. 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255.

-Exclusion ranges?
These are IP address ranges within a scope that will NOT be served by the DHCP server.

-Reservation?
These are specific IP addresses that are set aside for specific hosts, based on its MAC address.

-Dynamic assignment?
This is when DHCP is used for IP addressing, it's called dynamic because the address leases expire after a certain amount of time and have to be renewed. Ergo dynamic IP addresses are not permanent.

-Static assignment?
This is when IP addressing is NOT configured with DHCP, rather it is done manually or with a script. In any case, these addresses do not expire on their own, which makes static assignment useful for configuring IP addressing on servers and other key network devices.

-Lease time?
This is the amount of time that DHCP clients will retain their IP addressing that was assigned by the DHCP server. The default lease time is around 8 days, although it depends on the DHCP server configuration.

-Scope options?
Other settings that the DHCP server provides to its clients that aren't just IP address, e.g. subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server, domain name, and much more.

-Available leases?
DHCP IP addresses that are available.

-DHCP relay?


-IP helper/UDP forwarding?
